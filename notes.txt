constexpr matters because it guarantees values are 
known at compile time, allowing the compiler to safely 
allocate memory, enforce timing, and verify system 
constraints—something const does not always guarantee. 

Globals are dangerous because they hide dependencies 
and side effects, making it unclear which data a 
function relies on or modifies, which increases the
risk of subtle bugs in safety-critical systems.
